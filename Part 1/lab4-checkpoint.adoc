==== Viewing CA certificates ====

. Let's view the Root CAs preinstalled in your web browser. Open Firefox and go to
`about:preferences#privacy`. Scroll all the way to Certificates and click "View Certificates".

. List all the CAs that you see from the "Two-level Chain-of-Trust" example on the lab webpage.


   VeriSign, Symantec Corporation


. For the Symantec Root CA click on View to view the Root CA for either the Class 1 or Class 2 entries.
List the Issuer Name Common Name, and the Public key algorithm used.
** Issuer Name(Common Name): Symantec Class 1 Public Primary Certification Authority - G6
** Public Key Algorithm: RSA

. If we setup a new root CA specific to Swarthmore, how will browsers of all the devices in
Swarthmore recognize our root CA? What about machines outside of Swarthmore's jurisdiction?


   Machines outside of Swarthmore's jurisdiction would have to manually install the root CA as a trusted authority,
   since no browser is going to have it pre-installed. For the devices in Swarthmore, the certificate could come with
   using a device on the Swarthmore network.

   
   

==== Setting up the configuration file `openssl.cnf`

. Explain what the distinguished name stands for in the config file.


   The distinguished name contains the information of the entity that the certificate is being issued to.
   It contains the country, state, and other such information.

. Explain what the CA_default section contains in the config file.


   Lays out the default settings for certificates, determining things like which folder the certs and crls go to,
   where the current ones are kept, where the certificate database is, etc.


. Explain what the serial number is used for.


   The serial number is used as a unique identifier for each certificate.

==== Setting up the Root CA


   A self-signed certificate is just a certificate that hasn't been thoroughly vetted and signed by a CA.
   They can be more convenient to use for e.g. internal uses but are risky.

. What public key algorithm was used to generate the Root CA certificate?


   RSA Encryption


. What part of the root CA certificate indicates this is a self-signed certificate?

   
   The fact that the issuer is www.swatCA.com which is the same as the subject. This means that the certificate is self-signed.
   
   

. In the RSA algorithm, we have a public exponent e, a private exponent d, a modulus n, 
   and two secret numbers p and q, such that n = pq. Identify the values for these elements 
   in your certificate and key files.
   
   
   public exponent: 65537
   private exponent: 1c:89:b8:6d:64:de:89:be:da:8c:6b:b2:17:ed:20:

==== Setting up the certificates for cs88.com

. Do you expect cs88_key.pem to have different RSA private and public key and exponents from swatCA.key?


   They should have the same exponent but different keys.

   
   

. Explain why setting a policy to a specific value is important using https://www.phildev.net/ssl/opensslconf.html[this link].


   Setting a policy is important because if it is set to policy_anything then all that is needed for a request is a common name,
   while we may want more information.
   

. Using the same reference above, explain the contents you see in index.txt


   The index.txt file is a database of certificates. For us it shows Valid certificates (marked with V), an expiration date in 2034, 
   serial number 1000, unknown file location, and the distinguished name.
   

. Once we copy the extension fields for our root CA signature, what do you observe when you run `rootCA_sign_cert.sh` for the second time?


   The .pem file contains the alternate names. There is another entry in the database index.txt file.
   
   
. Specify why you would see the Firefox warning if you were to visit https://www.cs88w.com.


     Because cs88w is not part of the trusted names.
     
     
==== MiTM attack

. When you run `dig google.com` what address do you think www.google.com maps to?

   142.251.40.206


. Once you overwrite the mapping for `www.google.com` to `93.184.216.34` and then launch Firefox and type `https://www.google.com`
  What do you observe? If you see a warning message - then click on the advanced button to learn more about why Firefox wonâ€™t 
  let you proceed. Explain why this MiTM attack fails when www.example.com tries to impersonate www.google.com.


   Because Firefox is checking the certificate and sees that example.com's certificate is not valid for 
   google.com. Therefore, it doesn't trust the site.
   
   

. Next, explain how and why your more advanced  Man in the middle attack works.

   
   
   Since we were able to force the SwatCA to sign off the certificate request from example.com, 
   it became trusted, and then we were able to intercept the traffic to the real example.com to our fake one. 
   
   We were able to do this because we assumed the private key is stolen, which leads to the security system failing.
